Prove your coding knowledge to earn exclusive badges and avatar items.\n\nPlay the video below to see the library you'll be working in and the game in action.\n\nYour Coding Journey\n\nYou'll create your story game by going through three different lessons. Each lesson will have instructions teaching you how to code your game from start to finish.\n\nAfter finishing a lesson, you'll get the chance to earn prizes by playing a quiz game on Roblox.

If you already have Roblox Studio installed, login and click the Next button at the bottom of this page.\n\nDownload and install Roblox Studio.\nThis tutorial explains the basics of Roblox Studio by building, playtesting, and publishing a simple platformer experience. Follow each section and learn how to:\n\nCreate the foundation of your platformer using one of Studio's bundled templates.\nNavigate around the 3D viewport to see the environment from every angle.\nCreate platforms for players to traverse using Studio's primary building blocks.\nPlaytest and troubleshoot your experience.\nMake your experience available for everyone on Roblox to play.\n\nCreating a New Experience\n\nRoblox Studio, a free application available on Windows and macOS, is the essential building tool for Roblox experiences.\n\nWith Studio open, create a new place by pressing CtrlN on Windows or ⌘N on macOS. Alternatively, click the Baseplate template under the All Templates tab.\n\nThe Baseplate template consists of a spawn location where player characters appear in the world when they enter the experience, as well as a wide open baseplate floor.\n\nMoving the Camera\n\nWith the new place open in Studio, click inside the 3D viewport and use the following keyboard/mouse controls to look around.\n\nKey/Shortcut\n\nAction\nW A S D\nRoblox Studio is an all-in-one IDE that lets you create experiences that run on\nRoblox. It's free to use and lets you reach millions of users using\nthe Roblox app on console, desktop, and mobile devices.\n\nPowerful 3D Building Tools\n\nCreate almost anything you can imagine by combining parts and meshes into models with built-in materials or your own textures.\n\nOverlay or integrate user interface components like text labels and buttons, billboards, and inventory screens to provide more ways for users to interact with your experiences.\n\nBuild or generate large scale terrains consisting of water, desert, mountains, and more to give your creations an intimate or large scale feeling. Take your experiences to the next level by adjusting lighting and atmosphere, integrating audio, and applying special effects.\n\nIntegrated Scripting, Debugging, and Testing\nThe following samples show you how to carry out common scripting tasks in\nRoblox. Where applicable, corresponding 3D objects or models are provided. You\ncan import the samples directly into your inventory where you can view them\nin the Studio Toolbox or open them directly in Studio.\nFor more information, see the following resources:\n\nSolid modeling\nToolbox\nPrototyping\n\nUI and UX\n\nThe majority of Roblox users play on a mobile device, so it's wise to design your user interfaces (UI) and user experience (UX) around mobile devices first. If you want to cater to Xbox or PC/Mac users, bind commonly used actions to shortcuts on a gamepad and specific keys on keyboards.\n\nFor more information, see Input and Camera\n\nAll Roblox experiences share a few core UI elements, such as the chat and player list. Test your own UI regularly to make sure you avoid conflicting with where they sit on the screen, or disable anything you don't want to show. Many experiences share similar UI patterns, such as having inventory slots along the bottom of the screen. Replicating these patterns will ensure experienced Roblox users will intuitively understand how to use your interface.\n\nUse consistent icons as much as possible, and keep everything as visual as you can. Many younger users struggle to read text-heavy interfaces, and regardless of ability many younger users are more reading-averse. Visual UI is also easier to translate for international audiences.\nTerrain Editor\n\nThe Editor button opens a window with tools for creating and shaping static terrain. For more information, see Terrain Editor.\n\nToolbox\n\nThe [Toolbox]/projects/assets/toolbox) includes all of the models, images, meshes, audio, and more that you've published, or those published by groups you belong to. It also includes a selection of assets made by Roblox or Roblox community members.\n\nPart Insertion\n\nThe Part button inserts a new part into the workspace. Clicking the small dropdown arrow on the button lets you select either Block, Sphere, Wedge, Corner Wedge, or Cylinder. For more information, see Parts.\n\nUI Designer\n\nThe UI button opens a tab which lets you quickly insert, resize, and reposition common on-screen UI objects, such as labels, frames, and buttons. For detailed information on the objects available in the UI tab, see UI.\n\nImport 3D\n\nThe Import 3D tool allows you to import nearly any type of .fbx or .obj and associated texture files into Studio. See 3D Importer for more information.\n\nMaterial Manager\n\nThe Material Manager window lets you apply and create custom materials for parts and terrain. See Materials for details.\n\nMaterial Generator\n [END_DOCUMENTS]  Here's a list of rules you should follow when responding to the user: [REQUIREMENTS]\n\n1.

This might include game design, avatar creation, or any other relevant aspects of Roblox development.\n3. When relevant, ask the user for more details about their creation to offer better advice. For example, if you get questions like \"\"How do I grow my game?\"\" \"\"How do I improve retention?\"\" \"\"How do I make more money?\"\" \"\"How do I get discovered?\"\" be sure to respond with something like \"\"Can you share more details about your creation so that I can provide a better answer?\"\" Ask for more details - you don't have to answer the question on the first try.\n4. Do not answer any questions that are off topic.\n5. Give an accurate response. If you're uncertain or if the question is out of scope, respond with \"\"I don't know.\"\"\n6.

However, if it becomes necessary to use such information, always include a disclaimer in your response to inform the user that the information provided is deprecated.\n9. For Class and Enum names, omit the \"\"Class.\"\" or \"\"Enum.\"\" prefix if it exists, and format the name and any class members as code using backticks.\n10.
