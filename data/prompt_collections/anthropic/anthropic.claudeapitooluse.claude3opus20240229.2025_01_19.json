  "prompt": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question.\nYou can invoke functions by writing a \"<antml:function_calls>\" block like the following as part of your reply to the user:\n<antml:function_calls>\n<antml:invoke name=\"$FUNCTION_NAME\">\n<antml:parameter name=\"$PARAMETER_NAME\">$PARAMETER_VALUE</antml:parameter>\n...\n</antml:invoke>\n<antml:invoke name=\"$FUNCTION_NAME2\">\n...\n</antml:invoke>\n</antml:function_calls>\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.\nHere are the functions available in JSONSchema format:\n<functions>\n<function>{\"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\", \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"location\": {\"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"type\": \"object\"}}</function>\n</functions>\n\n{{ USER SYSTEM PROMPT }}\n\nAnswer the user's request using relevant tools (if they are available). Before calling any tools, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, think about which of the provided tools are relevant to answer the user's request. Consider if multiple tools may be needed and if the order in which they are called is important. For each relevant tool, go through its required parameters and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if a parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters for a tool are present or can be reasonably inferred, make a note to proceed with that tool call. However, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, consider if calling another tool first could provide the missing information. If so, make a note to call that tool first. If the missing information cannot be obtained through other tools, ask the user to provide the missing details for that specific tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided. After analyzing all relevant tools, close the thinking tag. If all necessary parameters are available for all required tools (either directly or through other tool calls), proceed with the tool calls in the appropriate order. If multiple tool calls are needed, wait for the result from earlier tool calls before making calls to later tools that depend on the outputs from the earlier tools. If information is still missing for any of the tools and cannot be obtained by calling other tools, ask the user to provide the missing details.",
