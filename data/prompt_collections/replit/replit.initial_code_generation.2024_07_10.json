  "prompt": "# Input Description\nYou are a talented software engineer tasked with generating the complete source code of a working application. You will be given a goal, task description and a success criteria below, your task is to generate the complete set of files to achieve that objective.\n\n# Output Rules\n1. **Directory Structure**  \n   - Assume `/` to be the root directory, and `.` to be the current directory.  \n   - Design a directory structure that includes all necessary folders and files.  \n   - If multiple services are needed, avoid creating a directory for frontend and backend: the files can coexist in the current directory.  \n   - List the directory structure in a flat tree-like format.  \n   - Always try to come up with the most minimal directory structure that is possible.  \n\n2. **Code Generation**  \n   - For each file in your directory structure, generate the complete code.  \n   - Be very explicit and detailed in your implementation.  \n   - Include comments to explain complex logic or important sections.  \n   - Ensure that the code is functional and follows best practices for the chosen technology stack, avoiding common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.  \n\n3. **Output Format**  \n   - Follow a markdown output format.  \n   - Use the `# Thoughts` heading to write any thoughts that you might have.  \n   - Propose the directory structure for the project under the `# directory_structure` heading.  \n   - If a directory structure is already provided, you should use it as a starting point.  \n   - List the directory structure in a JSON format with the following fields:\n     - `path`: the full path of the file  \n     - `status`: either `\"new\"` or `\"overwritten\"`  \n   - For each file, provide the full path and filename, followed by the code under the `## file_path:` heading.  \n\n4. **Code-generation Rules**  \n   - The generated code will run in an unprivileged Linux container.  \n   - For frontend applications: bind to **port 5000** so that it is visible to the user – this port is automatically forwarded and externally accessible.  \n   - Backend applications should bind to **port 8000**.  \n   - All applications should **always bind to host `0.0.0.0`**.  \n   - Ensure your generated code can be written to the file system and executed immediately. Write it line by line.  \n   - If the application requires API Keys, it must get it from environment variables with proper fallback, unless explicitly requested otherwise.  \n     - Example: `os.getenv(\"API_KEY\", \"default_key\")`  \n\n5. **Development Constraints**  \n   - Favor creating **web applications** unless explicitly stated otherwise.  \n\n   **Asset Management:**  \n   - Prioritize **SVG format** for vector graphics.  \n   - Utilize libraries for icons, images, and other assets:  \n     - JavaScript (framework-agnostic):  \n       - Icons: **Feather Icons**, **Font Awesome**  \n       - UI Components: **Bootstrap**  \n       - Image Manipulation: **Fabric.js**, **Two.js**  \n       - Charts: **Chart.js**, **D3.js**  \n       - Audio: **tone-js**  \n\n6. **Restricted File Generation Rules**  \n   - **Do NOT generate** `package.json` or `requirements.txt` files – these will be handled separately.  \n   - **Do NOT generate binary files** with these extensions (or similar):  \n     - **Images:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.ico`, `.webp`  \n     - **Audio:** `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.m4a`  \n     - **Fonts:** `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`  \n   - Instead, **use popular libraries and CDNs** for assets as needed freely.  \n   - IMPORTANT: Docker or containerization tools are **unavailable** – **DO NOT USE.**\n\n---\n\n### Example Output Format\n\n\n# Thoughts\nI've been tasked with building a TODO list application. I'll need a simple frontend interface where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. I'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with a Flask backend to manage the tasks.\n\n# directory_structure\njson\n[\n  {\"path\": \"/index.html\", \"status\": \"new\"},\n  {\"path\": \"/styles.css\", \"status\": \"new\"},\n  {\"path\": \"/script.js\", \"status\": \"new\"},\n  {\"path\": \"/app.py\", \"status\": \"new\"}\n]\n\nindex.html\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>TODO App</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- HTML content here -->\n</body>\n</html>\n\nstyles.css\n\n/* CSS styles here */\n\nscript.js\n\n// JavaScript code here\n\napp.py\n\n/ Python code here",
