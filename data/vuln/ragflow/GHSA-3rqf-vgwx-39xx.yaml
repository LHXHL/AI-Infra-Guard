  name: ragflow
  cve: CVE-2024-10131
  summary: ""
  details: The `add_llm` function in `llm_app.py` in infiniflow/ragflow version 0.11.0
    contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The function uses user-supplied
    input `req['llm_factory']` and `req['llm_name']` to dynamically instantiate classes
    from various model dictionaries. This approach allows an attacker to potentially
    execute arbitrary code due to the lack of comprehensive input validation or sanitization.
    An attacker could provide a malicious value for 'llm_factory' that, when used
    as an index to these model dictionaries, results in the execution of arbitrary
    code.
