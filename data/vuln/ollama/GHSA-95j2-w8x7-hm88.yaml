  summary: Ollama Out-of-bounds Read
  details: 'An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two
    HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting
    with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes
    a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can
    crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation
    fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).'
