  summary: ""
  details: An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.34. The CreateModelHandler
    function uses os.Open to read a file until completion. The req.Path parameter
    is user-controlled and can be set to /dev/random, which is blocking, causing the
    goroutine to run infinitely (even after the HTTP request is aborted by the client).
