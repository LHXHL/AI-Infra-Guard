  cve: CVE-2024-2928
  summary: Local File Inclusion in mlflow
  details: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow,
    specifically in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability
    arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory
    traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating
    the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system,
    including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to
    a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query
    string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI
    to prevent LFI attacks.
