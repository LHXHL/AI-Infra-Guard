  cve: CVE-2024-3099
  summary: Undefined Behavior in mlflow
  details: A vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.1 allows attackers to create
    multiple models with the same name by exploiting URL encoding. This flaw can lead
    to Denial of Service (DoS) as an authenticated user might not be able to use the
    intended model, as it will open a different model each time. Additionally, an
    attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform data model poisoning by creating
    a model with the same name, potentially causing an authenticated user to become
    a victim by using the poisoned model. The issue stems from inadequate validation
    of model names, allowing for the creation of models with URL-encoded names that
    are treated as distinct from their URL-decoded counterparts.
