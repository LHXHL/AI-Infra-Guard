info:
  name: mlflow
  cve: CVE-2024-1593
  summary: mlflow vulnerable to Path Traversal
  details: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository due
    to improper handling of URL parameters. By smuggling path traversal sequences
    using the ';' character in URLs, attackers can manipulate the 'params' portion
    of the URL to gain unauthorized access to files or directories. This vulnerability
    allows for arbitrary data smuggling into the 'params' part of the URL, enabling
    attacks similar to those described in previous reports but utilizing the ';' character
    for parameter smuggling. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information
    disclosure or server compromise.
