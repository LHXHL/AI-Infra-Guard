  name: mlflow
  cve: CVE-2024-4263
  summary: MLflow allows low privilege users to delete any artifact
  details: A broken access control vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow versions
    before 2.10.1, where low privilege users with only EDIT permissions on an experiment
    can delete any artifacts. This issue arises due to the lack of proper validation
    for DELETE requests by users with EDIT permissions, allowing them to perform unauthorized
    deletions of artifacts. The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of
    artifact deletions within the application, as demonstrated by the ability of a
    low privilege user to delete a directory inside an artifact using a DELETE request,
    despite the official documentation stating that users with EDIT permission can
    only read and update artifacts, not delete them.
