  cve: CVE-2024-21645
  summary: pyload Log Injection vulnerability
  details: |-
    ### Summary
    A log injection vulnerability was identified in `pyload`. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated actor to inject arbitrary messages into the logs gathered by `pyload`.
    ### Details
    `pyload` will generate a log entry when attempting to sign in with faulty credentials. This entry will be in the form of `Login failed for user 'USERNAME'`. However, when supplied with a username containing a newline, this newline is not properly escaped. Newlines are also the delimiter between log entries. This allows the attacker to inject new log entries into the log file.
