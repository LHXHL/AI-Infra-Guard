  name: jupyter-server
  cve: CVE-2020-26232
  summary: Open redirect in Jupyter Server
  details: |-
    ### Impact
    _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

    Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

    All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.

    This originated in jupyter/notebook: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-c7vm-f5p4-8fqh

    ### Patches

    _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

    jupyter_server 1.0.6
