  cve: CVE-2020-26275
  summary: Jupyter Server open redirect vulnerability
  details: |-
    ### Impact
    _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

    Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

    All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.

    ### Patches

    _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

    Patched in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix:

    ```
    jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/
    ```
