  name: anythingllm
  cve: CVE-2024-5211
  summary: ""
  details: A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a
    manager to bypass the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path
    traversal attacks. This vulnerability enables the manager to read, delete, or
    overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other files stored in the 'storage'
    directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets. Exploitation
    of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service
    (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper
    validation of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for
    the app, which can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or
    overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting critical files required for
    the application's operation.
