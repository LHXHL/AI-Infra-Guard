  cve: CVE-2024-3570
  summary: ""
  details: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the chat functionality
    of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary
    JavaScript in the context of a user's session. By manipulating the ChatBot responses,
    an attacker can inject malicious scripts to perform actions on behalf of the user,
    such as creating a new admin account or changing the user's password, leading
    to a complete takeover of the AnythingLLM application. The vulnerability stems
    from the improper sanitization of user and ChatBot input, specifically through
    the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Successful exploitation requires convincing
    an admin to add a malicious LocalAI ChatBot to their AnythingLLM instance.
