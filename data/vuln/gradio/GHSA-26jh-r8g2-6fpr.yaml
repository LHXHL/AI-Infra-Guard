  summary: Gradio's dropdown component pre-process step does not limit the values
    to those in the dropdown list
  details: "### Impact\n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability is a **data validation issue** in the Gradio `Dropdown` component's
    pre-processing step. Even if the `allow_custom_value` parameter is set to `False`,
    attackers can bypass this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary
    values, effectively breaking the developerâ€™s intended input constraints. While
    this alone is not a severe vulnerability, it can lead to more critical security
    issues, particularly when paired with other vulnerabilities like file downloads
    from the user's machine.\n\n### Patches\nYes, this issue is addressed in `gradio>=5.0`.
    Please upgrade to the latest version to resolve the problem.\n\n### Workarounds
    \ \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nTo
    mitigate the issue without upgrading, developers can add manual validation in
    their prediction function to check the received values against the allowed dropdown
    values before processing them."
