info:
  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-47869
  summary: Gradio performs a non-constant-time comparison when comparing hashes
  details: "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for
    the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant
    time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different
    requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized
    access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query
    the system with different keys.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>4.44`
    to mitigate this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix
    or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nTo mitigate the risk before
    applying the patch, developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard
    to use a **constant-time comparison** function for comparing sensitive values,
    such as hashes. Alternatively, access to the analytics dashboard can be disabled."
