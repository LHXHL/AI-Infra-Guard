  cve: CVE-2024-47167
  summary: Gradio vulnerable to SSRF in the path parameter of /queue/join
  details: "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join`
    endpoint. Gradioâ€™s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force
    the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable
    attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly
    exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content
    from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially
    malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that
    use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching.\n\n### Patches
    \ \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds
    \ \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs
    a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their
    Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally, implementing stricter
    URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local
    or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint
    can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks."
