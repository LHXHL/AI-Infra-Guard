info:
  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2021-43831
  summary: Files on the host computer can be accessed from the Gradio interface
  details: "### Impact\nThis is a vulnerability that affects anyone who creates and
    publicly shares Gradio interfaces using `gradio<2.4.8`. Because of the way that
    static files were being served, someone who generated a public Gradio link and
    shared it with others would potentially be exposing the files on the computer
    that generated the link, while the link was active. An attacker would be able
    to view the contents of a file on the computer if they knew the exact relative
    filepath. We do not have any evidence that this was ever exploited, but we treated
    the issue seriously and immediately took steps to mitigate it (see below)\n\n###
    Response\n1. We worked with @haby0 to immediately patch the issue and released
    a new version, `gradio 2.5.0`, within 24 hours of the issue being brought to our
    attention \n2. We enabled a notification that is printed to anyone using an older
    version of gradio telling them to upgrade (see screenshot below)\n3. We expanded
    our test suite to test for this vulnerability ensuring that our patch does not
    get reverted in future releases of `gradio`\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1778297/146251425-f36b519b-6d4a-4dfb-8d89-c1ed005979d3.png)\n\n###
    Patches\nThe problem has been patched in `gradio>=2.5.0`.\n"
