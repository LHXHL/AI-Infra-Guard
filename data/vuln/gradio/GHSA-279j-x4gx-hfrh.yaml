  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-47871
  summary: Gradio uses insecure communication between the FRP client and server
  details: "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability involves **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse
    Proxy) client and server when Gradio's `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not
    enforced on the connection, allowing attackers to intercept and read files uploaded
    to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client
    and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos publicly over the
    internet using `share=True` without proper encryption, exposing sensitive data
    to potential eavesdroppers.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5`
    to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix
    or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, users
    can avoid using `share=True` in production environments and instead host their
    Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure communication."
