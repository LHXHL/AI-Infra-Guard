  cve: CVE-2024-4325
  summary: Server-Side Request Forgery in gradio
  details: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio
    and was discovered in version 4.21.0, specifically within the `/queue/join` endpoint
    and the `save_url_to_cache` function. The vulnerability arises when the `path`
    value, obtained from the user and expected to be a URL, is used to make an HTTP
    request without sufficient validation checks. This flaw allows an attacker to
    send crafted requests that could lead to unauthorized access to the local network
    or the AWS metadata endpoint, thereby compromising the security of internal servers.
