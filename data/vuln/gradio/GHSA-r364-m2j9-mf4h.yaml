  cve: CVE-2024-2206
  summary: gradio Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability
  details: An SSRF vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio due to insufficient
    validation of user-supplied URLs in the `/proxy` route. Attackers can exploit
    this vulnerability by manipulating the `self.replica_urls` set through the `X-Direct-Url`
    header in requests to the `/` and `/config` routes, allowing the addition of arbitrary
    URLs for proxying. This flaw enables unauthorized proxying of requests and potential
    access to internal endpoints within the Hugging Face space. The issue arises from
    the application's inadequate checking of safe URLs in the `build_proxy_request`
    function.
