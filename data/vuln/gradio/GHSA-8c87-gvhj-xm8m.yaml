  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-47867
  summary: Gradio lacks integrity checking on the downloaded FRP client
  details: "### Impact\nThis vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the
    downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious
    code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client
    is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server
    does not verify the file's checksum or signature. \n\n**Who is impacted?**  \nAny
    users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client
    could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable
    binary for secure data tunneling.\n\n### Patches\nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5.0`,
    which includes a fix to verify the integrity of the downloaded binary.\n\n###
    Workarounds\nThere is no direct workaround for this issue without upgrading. However,
    users can manually validate the integrity of the downloaded FRP client by implementing
    checksum or signature verification in their own environment to ensure the binary
    hasn't been tampered with."
