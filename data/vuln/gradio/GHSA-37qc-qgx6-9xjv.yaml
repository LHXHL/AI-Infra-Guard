  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-47166
  summary: Gradio has a one-level read path traversal in `/custom_component`
  details: "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability involves a **one-level read path traversal** in the `/custom_component`
    endpoint. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access and leak source code from
    custom Gradio components by manipulating the file path in the request. Although
    the traversal is limited to a single directory level, it could expose proprietary
    or sensitive code that developers intended to keep private. This impacts users
    who have developed custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly accessible
    servers.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this
    issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the
    vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, developers can sanitize
    the file paths and ensure that components are not stored in publicly accessible
    directories."
