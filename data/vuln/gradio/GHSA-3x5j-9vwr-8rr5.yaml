  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2023-25823
  summary: Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling
  details: "### Impact\nThis is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's
    share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio
    versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key
    is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user
    could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are
    possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. \n\n###
    Patches\nThe problem has been patched. Ideally, users should upgrade to `gradio==3.19.1`
    or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. \n\n### Credit\nCredit
    to Greg Sadetsky and Samuel Tremblay-Cossette for alerting the team"
