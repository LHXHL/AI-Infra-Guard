  cve: CVE-2024-47870
  summary: Gradio has a race condition in update_root_in_config may redirect user
    traffic
  details: "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis
    vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function,
    allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate
    with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic
    to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such
    as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect
    to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious
    actors could exploit this race condition.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade
    to `gradio>=5` to address this issue."
