info:
  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-4253
  summary: ""
  details: A command injection vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository,
    specifically within the 'test-functional.yml' workflow. The vulnerability arises
    due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, allowing
    for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration.
    The issue affects versions up to and including '@gradio/video@0.6.12'. The flaw
    is present in the workflow's handling of GitHub context information, where it
    echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow
    reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration
    of sensitive secrets such as 'GITHUB_TOKEN', 'COMMENT_TOKEN', and 'CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN'.
