  summary: phi4mm: Quadratic Time Complexity in Input Token Processing leads to denial of service
  details: |
    ### Summary
    A critical performance vulnerability has been identified in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. Due to inefficient list concatenation operations, the algorithm exhibits quadratic time complexity (O(n²)), allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs.
    ### Details
    Affected Component: input_processor_for_phi4mm function.
    https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/8cac35ba435906fb7eb07e44fe1a8c26e8744f4e/vllm/model_executor/models/phi4mm.py#L1182-L1197
    The code modifies the input_ids list in-place using input_ids = input_ids[:i] + tokens + input_ids[i+1:]. Each concatenation operation copies the entire list, leading to O(n) operations per replacement. For k placeholders expanding to m tokens, total time becomes O(kmn), approximating O(n²) in worst-case scenarios.
    ### PoC
    Test data demonstrates exponential time growth:
    ```python
    test_cases = [100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400]
    run_times = [0.002, 0.007, 0.028, 0.136, 0.616, 2.707, 11.854]  # seconds
    ```
    Doubling input size increases runtime by ~4x (consistent with O(n²)).
    ### Impact
    Denial-of-Service (DoS): An attacker could submit inputs with many placeholders (e.g., 10,000 <|audio_1|> tokens), causing CPU/memory exhaustion.
    Example: 10,000 placeholders → ~100 million operations.

  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to vllm>=0.8.5
    2. Precompute all placeholder positions and expansion lengths upfront.
    3. Replace dynamic list concatenation with a single preallocated array.
    ```python
    # Pseudocode for O(n) solution
    new_input_ids = []
    for token in input_ids:
        if token is placeholder:
            new_input_ids.extend([token] * precomputed_length)
        else:
            new_input_ids.append(token)
    ```
rule: version >= "0.8.0" && version < "0.8.5"
