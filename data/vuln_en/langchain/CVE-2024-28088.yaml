  cve: CVE-2024-28088
  summary: LangChain directory traversal vulnerability
  details: |
    LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language model online service, or remote code execution.

    3. Review and update your application's file handling and path validation mechanisms to prevent directory traversal attacks.
