  cve: CVE-2024-27444
  summary: LangChain Experimental vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
  details: |
    langchain_experimental (aka LangChain Experimental) before 0.0.52, part of LangChain before 0.1.8, allows an attacker to bypass the CVE-2023-44467 fix and execute arbitrary code via the `__import__`, `__subclasses__`, `__builtins__`, `__globals__`, `__getattribute__`, `__bases__`, `__mro__`, or `__base__` attribute in Python code. These are not prohibited by `pal_chain/base.py`.
