  name: langchain-ssrf-vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2024-3095
  summary: Server-Side Request Forgery in langchain-community Web Research Retriever
  details: |
    A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Web Research Retriever component of langchain-community. 
    The component does not restrict requests to remote internet addresses, allowing attackers to execute port scans, 
    access local services, and potentially read instance metadata from cloud environments. This could lead to arbitrary code execution 
    depending on the nature of the local services, although the vulnerability is limited to GET requests.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to langchain-community version 0.2.9 or higher.
    2. Implement a proxy to prevent requests to local addresses.
    3. Ensure that users opt-in to the feature that may trigger the SSRF vulnerability.
