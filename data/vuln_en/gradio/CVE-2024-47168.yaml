  name: gradio-monitoring-vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2024-47168
  summary: Monitoring not properly disabled in Gradio when `enable_monitoring` is set to `False`
  details: |
    The vulnerability involves data exposure due to the `enable_monitoring` flag not properly disabling monitoring when set to False. Even when monitoring is supposedly disabled, an attacker or unauthorized user can still access the monitoring dashboard by directly requesting the /monitoring endpoint. This means that sensitive application analytics may still be exposed, particularly in environments where monitoring is expected to be disabled.
