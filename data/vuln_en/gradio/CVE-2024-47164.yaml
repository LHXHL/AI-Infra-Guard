  name: gradio-directory-traversal-bypass
  cve: CVE-2024-47164
  summary: Bypass of directory traversal checks in Gradio's `is_in_or_equal` function
  details: |
    The vulnerability relates to the bypass of directory traversal checks within the `is_in_or_equal` function. 
    This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads 
    that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted 
    files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying 
    on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to gradio>=5.0.0 to address this issue.
    2. As a workaround, manually sanitize and normalize file paths in your Gradio deployment before passing them 
       to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensure that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute to mitigate 
       bypass vulnerabilities caused by improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths.
rule: version > "0" && version < "5.0.0"
