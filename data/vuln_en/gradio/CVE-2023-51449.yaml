  cve: CVE-2023-51449
  summary: Gradio fixed vulnerabilities in the `/file` route against file traversal and SSRF attacks.
  details: |
    Older versions of `gradio` contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL if they knew the path of files to look for. This was possible through programmatic tools such as `curl` with the `--pass-as-is` flag. Furthermore, the `/file` route was also vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Both vulnerabilities have been fixed in `gradio==4.11.0`.
