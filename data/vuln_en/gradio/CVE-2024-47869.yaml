  name: gradio-timing-attack-vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2024-47869
  summary: Gradio performs a non-constant-time comparison when comparing hashes
  details: |
    This vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to gradio>4.44 to mitigate this issue.
    2. Manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a constant-time comparison function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes.
    3. Disable access to the analytics dashboard as a temporary workaround.
rule: version > "0" && version < "4.44.0"
