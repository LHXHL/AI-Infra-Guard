  summary: Gradio's dropdown component pre-process step does not limit the values to those in the dropdown list
  details: |
    This vulnerability is a **data validation issue** in the Gradio `Dropdown` component's pre-processing step. Even if the `allow_custom_value` parameter is set to `False`, attackers can bypass this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary values, effectively breaking the developerâ€™s intended input constraints. While this alone is not a severe vulnerability, it can lead to more critical security issues, particularly when paired with other vulnerabilities like file downloads from the user's machine.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  severity: LOW
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to gradio>=5.0 to resolve the issue.
    2. As a workaround, developers can add manual validation in their prediction function to check the received values against the allowed dropdown values before processing them.
rule: version >= "0" && version < "5.0.0"
