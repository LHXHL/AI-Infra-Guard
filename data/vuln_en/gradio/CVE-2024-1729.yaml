  name: gradio-timing-attack-vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2024-1729
  summary: Gradio apps vulnerable to timing attacks to guess password
  details: |
    This security issue relates to a timing attack that allows users of Gradio apps to potentially guess the password of password-protected Gradio apps. 
    The vulnerability arises because string comparisons in Python terminate early upon a mismatch, and Gradio apps are not rate-limited by default, 
    enabling brute-force attempts to guess usernames and passwords.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to gradio>=4.19.2
    2. Implement rate limiting for login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks
rule: version > "0" && version < "4.19.2"
