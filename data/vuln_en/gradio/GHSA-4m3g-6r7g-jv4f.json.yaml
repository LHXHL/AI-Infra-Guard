  cve: CVE-2024-4367
  summary: Arbitrary JavaScript execution due to using outdated pdf.js library
  details: |
    gradio-pdf projects with dependencies on the pdf.js library are vulnerable to CVE-2024-4367, which allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Malicious scripts can be injected into the code, and when linked with vulnerabilities such as CSRF, it can cause even greater damage.
    
    ### PoC
    1. Generate a pdf file with a malicious script in the fontmatrix. (This will run `alert('XSS').`)

    2. Run the app. In this PoC, I've used the demo for a simple proof.

    3. Upload a PDF file containing the script.

    4. Check that the script is running.

  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade the pdf.js to v4.2.67, which removes the vulnerability.
    2. Alternatively, set the option `isEvalSupported` to `false`.
