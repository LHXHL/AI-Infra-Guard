  cve: CVE-2024-5982
  summary: Path traversal vulnerability in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt
  details: |
    A path traversal vulnerability exists in the latest version of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt due to unsanitized input handling in multiple features. 
    - The `load_chat_history` function allows arbitrary file uploads, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).
    - The `get_history_names` function permits arbitrary directory creation.
    - The `load_template` function can be exploited to leak the first column of CSV files.
    These issues arise from improper sanitization of user inputs concatenated with directory paths using `os.path.join`.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
