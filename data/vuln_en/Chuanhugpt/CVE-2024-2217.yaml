  summary: Improper access control in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt allows unauthorized access to config.json.
  details: |
    The vulnerability in gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt arises from improper handling of HTTP requests for the `config.json` file,
    which does not adequately restrict access based on user authentication. This allows attackers to obtain sensitive information
    such as API keys (`openai_api_key`, `google_palm_api_key`, `xmchat_api_key`, etc.), configuration details, and user credentials,
    regardless of whether the application is accessed in authenticated or unauthenticated mode.
