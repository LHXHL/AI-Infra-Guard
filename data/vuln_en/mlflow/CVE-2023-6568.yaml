  name: mlflow-xss-vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2023-6568
  summary: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in MLflow
  details: |
    A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the handling of the Content-Type header in POST requests. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Content-Type header, which is then improperly reflected back to the user without adequate sanitization or escaping, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is present in the mlflow/server/auth/__init__.py file, where the user-supplied Content-Type header is directly injected into a Python formatted string and returned to the user, facilitating the XSS attack.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to mlflow >= 2.9.0
    2. Review and sanitize all user inputs, especially headers, to prevent XSS attacks
    3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks
rule: version < "2.9.0"
