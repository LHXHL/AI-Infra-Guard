  summary: HTML injection in JupyterLite leading to DOM Clobbering
  details: |
    The vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature.
    
    A malicious user can access any data accessible from JupyterLite and perform arbitrary actions in JupyterLite environment.
    
    JupyterLite 0.4.1 was patched.
    
    There is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk.
    
    To disable these extensions populate the `disabledExtensions` key in `jupyter-config-data` stanza of `jupyter-lite.json`.
    
    To confirm that the plugins were disabled manual inspection of the built page is required.

  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to JupyterLite >= 0.4.1
    2. Disable the following extensions in `jupyter-lite.json` to minimize risk:
       - `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin`
       - `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin`
       - `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package)
    3. Manually inspect the built page to confirm that the plugins were disabled.
rule: version < "0.4.1"
