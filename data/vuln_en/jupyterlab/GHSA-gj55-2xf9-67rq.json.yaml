  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to JupyterLite >= 0.4.1
    2. Disable select plugins on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion:
       - `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin`
       - `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin`
       - `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package)
    3. Populate the `disabledExtensions` key in `jupyter-config-data` stanza of `jupyter-lite.json` as documented on https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/configure/config_files.html#jupyter-lite-json
