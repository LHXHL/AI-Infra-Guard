  cve: CVE-2024-35225
  summary: Reflected XSS issue in Jupyter Server Proxy host parameter
  details: |
    There is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `jupyter-server-proxy`. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor.

  severity: CRITICAL
