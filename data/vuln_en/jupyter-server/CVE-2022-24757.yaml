  cve: CVE-2022-24757
  summary: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in Jupyter notebook
  details: |
    Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server.

    3. Restrict access to Jupyter Server logs to authorized personnel only.
