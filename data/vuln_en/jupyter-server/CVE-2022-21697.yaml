  name: jupyter-server
  cve: CVE-2022-21697
  summary: SSRF vulnerability in jupyter-server-proxy
  details: |
    ### Impact
    **What kind of vulnerability is it?** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    **Who is impacted?** Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled.
    A lack of input validation allowed authenticated clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity.
