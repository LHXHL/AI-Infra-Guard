  cve: CVE-2024-39721
  summary: Infinite loop vulnerability in Ollama due to uncontrolled file path input
  details: |
    An issue was discovered in Ollama before version 0.1.34. The CreateModelHandler function uses os.Open to read a file until completion. 
    The req.Path parameter is user-controlled and can be set to /dev/random, which is blocking, causing the goroutine to run infinitely 
    (even after the HTTP request is aborted by the client).
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to Ollama version 0.1.34 or later.
    2. Implement input validation for the req.Path parameter to prevent redirection to blocking resources like /dev/random.
    3. Monitor and review server logs for signs of infinite loops or unusual resource consumption.
rule: version < "0.1.34"
