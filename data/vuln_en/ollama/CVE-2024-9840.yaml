  summary: DoS vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui due to improper multipart boundary handling
  details: |
    A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in open-webui/open-webui version 0.3.21. 
    This vulnerability affects multiple endpoints, including `/ollama/models/upload`, 
    `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions`, and `/rag/api/v1/doc`. The application processes multipart 
    boundaries without authentication, leading to resource exhaustion. By appending additional 
    characters to the multipart boundary, an attacker can cause the server to parse each byte 
    of the boundary, ultimately leading to service unavailability. This vulnerability can be 
    exploited remotely, resulting in high CPU and memory usage, and rendering the service 
    inaccessible to legitimate users.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to open-webui/open-webui >=0.3.22
    2. Implement authentication for multipart boundary processing
    3. Monitor server resources for unusual activity
rule: version < "0.3.22"
