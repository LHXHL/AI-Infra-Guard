  summary: Out-Of-Memory (OOM) vulnerability in `ollama` server
  details: |
    An Out-Of-Memory (OOM) vulnerability exists in the `ollama` server version 0.3.14. 
    This vulnerability can be triggered when a malicious API server responds with a gzip bomb HTTP response, 
    leading to the `ollama` server crashing. The vulnerability is present in the `makeRequestWithRetry` 
    and `getAuthorizationToken` functions, which use `io.ReadAll` to read the response body. 
    This can result in excessive memory usage and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
