  name: ollama-out-of-bounds-read
  cve: CVE-2024-39720
  summary: Ollama Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability
  details: |
    An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).

    1. Upgrade to ollama>=0.1.46
    2. Implement input validation for GGUF files to prevent malformed file uploads
    3. Monitor and log suspicious activities related to file uploads and application crashes
