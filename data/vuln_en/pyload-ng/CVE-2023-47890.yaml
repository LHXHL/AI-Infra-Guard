info:
  name: pyload-ng
  cve: CVE-2023-47890
  summary: Download to arbitrary folder can lead to RCE
  details: |
    A web UI user can store files anywhere on the pyLoad server and gain command execution by abusing scripts.
    When a user creates a new package, a subdirectory is created within the /downloads folder to store files. This new directory name is derived from the package name, except a filter is applied to make sure it can't traverse directories and stays within /downloads. However, when editing packages there is no prevention in place and a user can just pick any arbitrary directory in the filesystem.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    1. Login to a pyLoad instance
    2. Go to "Queue" and create a new package with any name and a valid link
    3. Click "Edit Package" on the newly created package and set the folder as "/config/scripts/download_finished/"
    4. Restart the package 
    5. Check the server filesystem and note the link was downloaded and stored inside "/config/scripts/download_finished/"
    
    Remote code execution proof-of-concept:
    It is possible to use this issue to abuse scripts and gain remote control over the pyLoad server.
