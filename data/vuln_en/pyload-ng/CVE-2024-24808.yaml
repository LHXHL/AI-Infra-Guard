  cve: CVE-2024-24808
  summary: pyLoad open redirect vulnerability due to improper validation of the is_safe_url function
  details: |
    Open redirect vulnerability due to incorrect validation of input values when redirecting users after login.
    
    pyload is validating URLs via the `get_redirect_url` function when redirecting users at login. The URL entered in the `next` variable goes through the `is_safe_url` function, where a lack of validation can redirect the user to an arbitrary domain.
    
    For example, When an unusual URL like `https:///example.com` is entered, `urlparse` interprets it as a relative path, but in the actual request it is converted to `https://example.com` due to url normalization.
    
    An attacker can use this vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites, which can be used for phishing and similar attacks.
