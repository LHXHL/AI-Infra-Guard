  summary: ClickHouse vulnerable to client certificate password exposure in client exceptions
  details: |
    ### Summary
    When client certificate authentication is enabled with password protection, the password (referred to as the client option `sslkey`) may be exposed in client exceptions (e.g., ClickHouseException or SQLException). This vulnerability can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and violations of user privacy.
    ### Details
    During the handling of ClickHouseException, the client certificate password may be inadvertently exposed when sslkey is specified. This issue can arise when an exception is thrown during the execution of a query or a database operation. The client certificate password is then included in the exception message, which could be logged or exposed to unauthorized parties.
